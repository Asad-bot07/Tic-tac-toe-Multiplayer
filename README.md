# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe – C++ (2-Player Console Game)

This is a simple **2-player Tic Tac Toe game** built in C++ as part of my **internship project**. It runs in the console and allows two players to take turns marking `X` and `O` on a 3x3 board, with full win/draw detection.

## 📌 Why This Project?

- ✅ Internship Task
- 📚 Practicing basic game logic using C++
- 🧠 Laying the foundation for a **future AI bot** that can simulate human-like decisions for single-player mode (WIP)

## 🧠 What’s Next?

> **I'm currently working on a bot that can think like a real human and play against a single player.**  
> I'm facing a few logic/decision-making issues and I'm open to ideas.  
> 📝 Check out the `assets/` folder for my rough logic sketch (drawn in Excalidraw because my handwriting is terrible 😅).  
> **Suggestions welcome!**
